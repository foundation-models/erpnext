## Implementation Details

### 1. New Bank Account Created
- **Bank**: Axos Bank
- **GL Account**: Axos Business - DS (under Bank Accounts - DS)
- **Account Type**: Bank
- **Company**: DeepSpring

### 2. Method Used
Due to network connectivity issues with the ERPNext API, payments were created using a Python script executed directly inside the ERPNext Docker container:

**Script Location**: `/home/agent/workspace/erpnext/migration/create_october_payments.py`

**Execution Command**:
```bash
docker exec -i erpnext-app bench --site erpnext.localhost console < /home/agent/workspace/erpnext/migration/create_october_payments.py
```

### 3. Files Created/Updated
1. **create_october_payments.py** - Python script for creating payments via Frappe framework
2. **add_october_payments.sh** - Bash script for API-based creation (alternative method, not used due to connectivity)
3. **import_customer_payments.sh** - Updated with October 2025 Axos payments for reference
4. **progress.md** - Updated with complete documentation of the process

## Verification

All payments were verified in the database:
```sql
SELECT name, posting_date, party, paid_amount, reference_no, paid_to, docstatus 
FROM `tabPayment Entry` 
WHERE reference_no LIKE 'AXOS%' 
ORDER BY name;
```

## Current Status

✅ **Completed Tasks**:
- Axos Bank created in system
- Axos Business - DS GL account created
- Bank Account record linked
- All 4 payment entries created
- Database verification completed
- Documentation updated

⚠️ **Pending Actions**:
- Payment entries are in **Draft** status (docstatus=0)
- Need to be reviewed and **Submitted** through ERPNext UI to finalize

## Next Steps

To finalize these payment entries:

1. **Access ERPNext**:
   - Check which port ERPNext is accessible on (port 8000 may conflict)
   - Or use direct database/container access

2. **Review Payments**:
   - Navigate to: **Accounts → Payment Entry**
   - Filter by date: 2025-10-16
   - Or search by reference numbers: AXOS-20251016-*

3. **Submit Payments**:
   - Open each payment entry
   - Review details for accuracy
   - Click **Submit** to finalize
   - This will:
     - Lock the entry from further edits
     - Post the accounting entries to the ledger
     - Update account balances

## Missing Payments Still Not Recorded

Based on the original query, the following payments are still **NOT** in the system:

### Payment Returns (March 28, 2025)
- **Date**: 2025-03-28
- **Amount**: -$5,000
- **Type**: PI to DeepSpring via Chase (returned)

- **Date**: 2025-03-28
- **Amount**: -$5,000
- **Type**: MDC to DeepSpring via Chase (returned)

**Note**: These are payment returns (negative amounts) and will require special handling in ERPNext, possibly as Payment Entry with reversed direction or as Journal Entries.
